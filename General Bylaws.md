ballot shall be held on the first Tuesday in May in 2011, and the first Tuesday in March 2012 and
each year thereafter. The polls shall be open from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., and it shall be so stated

the adjournment thereof as follows. (STM 2010)

The Annual Town Meeting for the consideration of all business, other than the election of Town

event of a secular or other holiday during the Town Meeting Week, that session shall be
adjourned to the next night that shall be agreeable to the meeting by majority vote. No quorum or

event of a secular or other holiday, the Selectmen may determine an alternative date in October

agreeable to the meeting as established by majority vote. No quorum or minimum number of
voters shall be required for this meeting. (STM 2010)

### SECTION 3 POSTING OF WARRANTS
Warrants for Town Meeting shall be served by posting attested copies of the same in at least two
public places, by a time prior to the date at which the town meeting is to convene that is in
compliance with the Massachusetts General Laws. 

### SECTION 4 MODERATOR DETERMINATION ON SIGNS AND VISITORS AT TOWN MEETING
At the discretion of the Moderator, a portion of the hall may be reserved for visitors and open to
the public, and a portion of the hall may be reserved for the working press; the area at the front of
the hall and the stage may be occupied under the direction of the Moderator. Activities and signs
in the vicinity of the meeting room (e.g. entrance area and lobby of the High School) which voters
would normally encounter in the process of coming to or leaving the meeting require the
permission of both the Moderator and the organization ordinarily responsible for the space (e.g.
School Department). (ATM 1996)

### SECTION 5 TOWN MEETING QUORUM
No Town Meeting other than those described in Section 1 of the Article 2 shall take any action,
except to adjourn, unless there are 50 voters present, and the Moderator shall announce whether
or not a quorum is present immediately after the meeting is called to order. (STM 2010)

### SECTION 6 TOWN MEETING MOTIONS SECOND REQUIREMENT
The moderator may entertain motions without being seconded whenever in his judgment such
procedure is consistent with good order and proper transaction of business.

### SECTION 7 MOTIONS IN WRITING
All motions shall be in writing if so directed by the Moderator.

### SECTION 8 FRIVOLOUS MOTIONS
The Moderator may decline to put motions obviously frivolous or tending to disorder.

### SECTION 9 DEPUTY MODERATOR

meeting, or in case he is called away from the meeting.

### SECTION 10 ORDER OF MOTIONS
The Moderator, in presenting motions that differ only in the amount of money involved, shall
ordinarily put the largest sum first and, in questions that differ only in the amount of time involved,
shall ordinarily put the longest time first. 

### SECTION 11 PRECEDENCE OF MOTIONS
When a question is before the meeting, the following set of motions shall be used as a guide, and
shall ordinarily have precedence in their numerical order:

1. To adjourn
2. Take a recess
3. Rise to a question of privilege
4. Call for the previous question (Move the question, end debate)
5. Limit or extend limits of debate
6. Postpone to a certain time or particular place in the warrant
7. Commit, refer or recommit to a committee
8. Pass over
9. Amend
10. Main motion
 
But the treatment and order of receipt, of these and all other motions made in a Town Meeting
shall be left to the final decision of the Moderator.

### SECTION 12 RECONSIDERATION
Once final action has been taken on an article, and the meeting has taken up the next order of
business or has adjourned, the matter may not again be taken under consideration at that town
meeting unless, in the best judgment of the Moderator, a significant error or omission occurred in
the language or the process of the original action on the article, or a significant change of
circumstances has occurred, such that there is a clear likelihood that the outcome could change
upon reconsideration or that reconsideration would be in the Town’s best interest.

Such errors, omissions or changes of circumstance shall be brought to the Moderator’s attention
as soon as they are known, and the Moderator shall determine if and when the matter will be
taken up. The Moderator shall announce this decision to the town meeting. If the Moderator
determines that the matter may be taken up pursuant to this Section, a three-quarters vote shall
be necessary in order to proceed with reconsideration. (ATM 2005)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after all other votes and reconsideration from the floor are
complete, and if the size of the appropriations voted appear to make necessary a ballot override
vote (either levy, capital outlay or debt exclusion) under MGL 59 § 21C (_“Proposition 2 ½”_), then
the conditions for reconsideration shall be deemed to have been met, and the moderator shall
accept motions for reconsideration on any appropriation from the Advisory Finance Committee
only, for the purpose of reducing certain appropriations or all appropriations to meet the limits of
Proposition 2½, or for the purpose of making certain appropriations contingent upon an override
vote. (STM 2011)

### SECTION 13 SPEAKERS AT TOWN MEETING
No person shall address the meeting without first being recognized by the Moderator. When two
or more persons rise to speak at the same time, the Moderator shall name the one entitled to
speak.

### SECTION 14 NUMBER OF TIMES SPEAKERS MAY ADDRESS TOWN MEETING
No person shall speak more than twice upon any question, except to answer an inquiry, or to give
information requested, without first obtaining leave of the meeting, and then not until others, who
have not spoken upon the question, shall have spoken if they desire.

### SECTION 15 NON-VOTERS AT TOWN MEETING
At any Town Meeting held for the transaction of Town business, no person whose name is not
upon the list of voters shall be admitted to the floor of the hall or allowed to speak, unless a letter
of request in a form satisfactory to the Moderator has been presented by or on behalf of the
non-voter, and the meeting has by majority vote granted the request. Town employees who are
non-voters shall not be required to submit such a letter, but shall be admitted to the floor of the hall
if requested to attend by the board or town official to whom they report; they may address the
meeting. This Section shall not apply to the annual State and Town elections while the voters are
casting their ballots and pending the declaration of the same. (ATM 1991)

### SECTION 16 ARTICLES TAKEN OUT OF ORDER
Articles in the Warrant shall be acted upon in the order in which they stand, except that the
Moderator shall, upon request and for reasons stated, entertain a motion to take up an article out
of its regular order. Such motion shall be adopted openly on a two-thirds vote.

### SECTION 17 DISSOLVING TOWN MEETING
No motion, the effect of which would be to dissolve a Town Meeting, shall be in order until every
article in the Warrant has been duly considered and acted upon, but this shall not preclude the
postponement of action on or consideration of, any article to an adjournment of the meeting to a
stated time.

### SECTION 18 TOWN MEETING COMMITTEES
All committees shall be appointed by the Moderator unless otherwise specifically directed by the
meeting, and all committees so appointed shall be directed to report within a definite time. If a
committee does not report within the time stated, it shall be considered discharged unless in the
meantime the Town shall have granted an extension of time. 

### SECTION 19 VOTE COUNTING METHODS
When a question is put, the sense of the meeting shall be determined by a show of hands of the
Town Meeting members and the Moderator shall declare the vote as it appears to him. If the
Moderator is unable to decide the vote by the show of hands, or if his decision is immediately
questioned, he shall determine the vote by a standing vote and he may appoint tellers to make
and return the count.

On matters requiring a two-thirds vote by statute, the procedure shall be the same, and a standing
vote need not be taken unless the Moderator is unable to decide the vote by the show of hands, or
if his decision is immediately questioned. (ATM 1997)

In the alternative, at the discretion of the Moderator, an electronic handset voting system may be
employed that provides an accurate count as determined by the Town Clerk of the yeas and nays
on each question to the clerk and the moderator.

### SECTION 20 TOWN MEETING RECORDATION
Still and motion photography, televising, and videography shall be permitted only under the
following circumstances:

manner. Existing lighting shall be used, i.e. no additional external illumination shall be
utilized for the purpose of photographing or videotaping.

of whatever kind may be substituted therefore.

whom shall be a Town officer now elected by ballot, or an appointed official or a Town employee.

shall receive reasonable compensation for his services. The clerk of said Committee may or may
not be a member of the Committee. 

### SECTION 2 TERM OF OFFICE

annually and may periodically furnish to each department, board, or commission,
hereinafter referred to as the "licensing authority", that issues licenses or permits including
renewals and transfers, a list of any person, corporation, or business enterprise,
hereinafter referred to as the "party", that has neglected or refused to pay any local taxes,
fees, assessments, betterments or other municipal charges, and that such party has not
filed in good faith a pending application for an abatement of such tax or a pending petition
before the appellate tax board.

* (B) The licensing authority may deny, revoke, or suspend any license or permit, including
renewals and transfers of any party whose name appears on said list furnished to the
licensing authority from the Treasurer/Collector or with respect to any activity, event or
other matter which is subject of such license or permit and which activity, event or matter is
carried out or exercised or is to be carried out or exercised on or about real estate owned
by any party whose name appears on said list furnished to the licensing authority from the
Treasurer/Collector; provided however, that written notice is given to the party and the
Treasurer/Collector, as required by applicable provisions of law, and the party is given a
hearing, to be held no earlier than fourteen(14) days after said notice. Said list shall be
prima facie evidence for denial, revocation or suspension of said license or permit to any

licensing authority with respect to such license denial, revocation or suspension shall be
made only for the purpose of such proceeding and shall not be relevant to or introduced in
any other proceeding at law, except for any appeal from such license denial, revocation or
suspension. Any license or permit denied, suspended or revoked under this Bylaw shall

taxes, fees, assessments, betterments or other municipal charges, payable to the Town
as of the date of issuance of said certificate.

* (C) Any party shall be given an opportunity to enter into a payment agreement, thereby
allowing the licensing authority to issue a certificate indicating said limitations to the
license or permit and the validity of said license shall be conditional upon the satisfactory
compliance with said agreement. Failure to comply with said agreement shall be grounds
for the suspension or revocation of said license or permit; provided however, that the
holder be given notice and a hearing as required by applicable provisions of law.

* (D) The Board of Selectmen may waive such denial, suspension or revocation if it finds there
is no direct or indirect business interest by the property owner, its officers or stockholders,
if any, or members of his immediate family, as defined in Section One of Chapter 262 of
the Mass. General Laws in the business or activity conducted in or on said property.

## ARTICLE 32 – NON-ZONING WETLANDS PROTECTION
### SECTION 1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this bylaw is to protect the wetlands, water resources, flood prone areas, and
adjoining upland areas in the Town of Westborough, Massachusetts by controlling activities
deemed by the Conservation Commission likely to have a significant or cumulative effect on
resource area values, including but not limited to the following: public or private water supply,
groundwater supply, flood control, erosion and sedimentation control, storm damage prevention,
water quality, prevention and control of pollution, fisheries, wildlife habitat, rare species habitat
including rare plant and animal species, agriculture, aquaculture, and recreation values, deemed
important to the community (collectively, the “resource area values protected by this bylaw”).

This bylaw is intended to utilize the Home Rule authority of this municipality so as to protect the
resource areas under the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. Ch.131 §40; the Act) to a greater degree,
to protect additional resource areas beyond the Act recognized by the Town as significant, to
protect all resource areas for their additional values beyond those recognized in the Act, and to
impose in local regulations and permits additional standards and procedures stricter than those of
the Act and regulations there under (310 CMR 10.00), subject, however, to the rights and benefits
accorded to agricultural uses and structures of all kinds under the laws of the Commonwealth and
other relevant bylaws of the Town of Westborough, Massachusetts.

### SECTION 2 JURISDICTION
Except as permitted by the Conservation Commission no person shall commence to remove, fill,
dredge, build upon, degrade, discharge into, or otherwise alter the following resource areas: any
freshwater wetlands, marshes, wet meadows, bogs, swamps, vernal pools, springs, banks,
reservoirs, lakes, ponds of any size, beaches, lands under water bodies, intermittent streams,
brooks and creeks; lands adjoining these resource areas out to a distance of 100 feet, known as
the buffer zone; perennial rivers, streams, brooks and creeks; lands adjoining these resource
areas out to a distance of 200 feet, known as the riverfront area; lands subject to flooding or
inundation by groundwater or surface water including the 100-year flood plain; (collectively the
“resource areas protected by this bylaw”). Said resource areas shall be protected whether or not
they border surface waters.

The jurisdiction of this bylaw shall not extend to uses and structures of agriculture that enjoy the
rights and privileges of laws and regulations of the Commonwealth governing agriculture,
including work performed for normal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural or
aqua-cultural uses as defined by the Wetlands Protection Act regulations, found at 310 CMR
10.04.

### SECTION 3 EXEMPTIONS AND EXCEPTIONS
The applications and permits required by this bylaw shall not be required for work performed for
normal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural and aqua-cultural use as defined by
the Wetlands Protection Act regulations at 310 CMR 10.04 and for mosquito control projects..

The applications and permits required by this bylaw shall not be required for maintaining,
repairing, or replacing, but not substantially changing or enlarging, an existing and lawfully
located structure or facility used in the service of the public to provide electric, gas, water, 
telephone, telegraph, or other telecommunication services, provided that written notice has been
given to the Conservation Commission prior to commencement of work, and provided that the
work conforms to any performance standards and design specifications in regulations adopted by
the Commission.

The applications and permits required by this bylaw shall not be required for emergency projects
necessary for the protection of the health and safety of the public, provided that the work is to be
performed by or has been ordered to be performed by an agency of the Commonwealth or a
political subdivision thereof; provided that advance notice, oral or written, has been given to the
Commission prior to commencement of work or within 24 hours after commencement; provided
that the Commission or its agent certifies the work as an emergency project; provided that the
work is performed only for the time and place certified by the Commission for the limited purposes
necessary to abate the emergency; and provided that within 21 days of commencement of an
emergency project a permit application shall be filed with the Commission for review as provided
by this bylaw. Upon failure to meet these and other requirements of the Commission, the
Commission may, after notice and a public hearing, revoke or modify an emergency project
approval and order restoration and mitigation measures.

Other than stated in this bylaw, the exceptions provided in the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. Ch.
131 §40) and regulations (310 CMR 10.02(2)(b)(1)(a-g) shall apply under this bylaw.

### SECTION 4 APPLICATIONS AND FEES
Written application shall be filed with the Conservation Commission to perform activities affecting
resource areas protected by this bylaw. The permit application shall include such information and
plans as are deemed necessary by the Commission to describe proposed activities and their
effects on the resource areas protected by this bylaw. No activities shall commence without
receiving and complying with a permit issued pursuant to this bylaw.

The Commission in an appropriate case may accept as the application and plans under this bylaw
any application and plans filed under the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. Ch. 131 §40) and
regulations (310 CMR 10.00), but the Commission is not obliged to do so.

Any person desiring to know whether or not a proposed activity or an area is subject to this bylaw
may in writing request a determination from the Commission. Such a Request for Determination
of Applicability (RDA) or Abbreviated Notice of Resource Area Delineation (ANRAD) filed under
the Act shall include information and plans as are deemed necessary by the Commission.

Pursuant to G.L. Ch. 44 §53G and regulations promulgated by the Commission, the Commission
may impose reasonable fees upon applicants for the purpose of securing outside consultants
including engineers, wetlands scientists, wildlife biologists or other experts in order to aid in the
review of proposed projects. Such funds shall be deposited with the town treasurer, who shall
create an account specifically for this purpose. Additional consultant fees may be requested
where the requisite review is more expensive than originally calculated or where new information
requires additional consultant services. 

Only costs relating to consultant work done in connection with a project for which a consultant fee
has been collected shall be paid from this account, and expenditures may be made at the sole
discretion of the Commission. Any consultant hired under this provision shall be selected by, and
report exclusively to, the Commission. The Commission shall provide applicants with written
notice of the selection of a consultant, identifying the consultant, the amount of the fee to be
charged to the applicant, and a request for payment of that fee. Notice shall be deemed to have
been given on the date it is mailed or delivered. The applicant may withdraw the application or
request within five (5) business days of the date notice is given without incurring any costs or
expenses.

The entire fee must be received before the initiation of consulting services. Failure by the
applicant to pay the requested consultant fee within ten (10) business days of the request for
payment shall be cause for the Commission to declare the application administratively incomplete
and deny the permit without prejudice, except in the case of an appeal. The Commission shall
inform the applicant and Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) of such a decision in
writing.

The applicant may appeal the selection of an outside consultant to the Board of Selectmen, who
may disqualify the consultant only on the grounds that the consultant has a conflict of interest or is
not properly qualified. The minimum qualifications shall consist of either an educational degree or
three or more years of practice in the field at issue, or a related field. The applicant shall make
such an appeal in writing, and must be received within ten (10) business days of the date that
request for consultant fees was made by the Commission. Such appeal shall extend the
applicable time limits for action upon the application.

### SECTION 5 NOTICE AND HEARINGS
Any person filing a permit application with the Conservation Commission shall at the same time
give written notice thereof, by certified mail (return receipt requested) or hand delivered, to all
abutters at their mailing addresses shown on the most recent applicable tax list of the assessors,
including owners of land directly opposite on any public or private street or way, and abutters to
the abutters within 300 feet of the property line of the applicant, including any in another
municipality or across a body of water. The notice shall state a brief description of the project or
other proposal and the date of any Commission hearing or meeting date if known. The notice to
abutters shall state where copies of the application or request, with plans, may be examined and
obtained by abutters. An affidavit of the person providing such notice, with a copy of the notice
mailed or delivered, shall be filed with the Commission. When a person requesting a
determination is other than the owner, the request, the notice of the hearing and the determination
itself shall be sent by the Commission to the owner as well as to the person making the request.

The Commission shall conduct a public hearing on any permit application, with written notice
given at the expense of the applicant, at least five business days prior to the hearing, in a
newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. The Commission shall commence the public
hearing within 21 days from receipt of a completed permit application, unless an extension is
authorized in writing by the applicant. The Commission shall have authority to continue the
hearing to a specific date announced at the hearing, for reasons stated at the hearing, which may 
include the need for additional information from the applicant or others as deemed necessary by
the Commission in its discretion, based on comments and recommendations of the boards and
officials listed in §VI.

The Commission shall issue its permit, other order or determination in writing within 21 days of the
close of the public hearing thereon unless an extension is authorized in writing by the applicant.
The Commission in an appropriate case may combine its hearing under this bylaw with the
hearing conducted under the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. Ch.131 §40) and regulations (310
CMR 10.00).

### SECTION 6 COORDINATION WITH OTHER BOARDS

permit application pertains to property within 300 feet of that municipality. An affidavit of the
person providing notice, with a copy of the notice mailed or delivered, shall be filed with the
Commission. The above boards and officials shall have seven days to provide written comments
and recommendations with the Commission, which the Commission shall consider but which shall
not be binding on the Commission. The Commission has the discretion to extend the time to
submit written comments and recommendations from the above boards and officials. The
applicant shall have the right to receive any comments and recommendations, and to respond to
them at a hearing of the Commission, prior to final action.

### SECTION 7 PERMITS AND CONDITIONS
If the Conservation Commission, after a public hearing, determines that the activities which are
subject to the permit application, or the land and water uses which will result there from, are likely
to have a significant individual or cumulative effect on the resource area values protected by this
bylaw, the Commission, within 21 days of the close of the hearing, shall issue or deny a permit for
the activities requested. The Commission shall take into account the extent to which the applicant
has avoided, minimized and mitigated any such effect. The Commission also shall take into
account any loss, degradation, isolation, and replacement or replication of such protected
resource areas elsewhere in the community and the watershed, resulting from past activities,
whether permitted, not permitted or exempt, and foreseeable future activities.

If it issues a permit, the Commission shall impose conditions which the Commission deems
necessary or desirable to protect said resource area values, and all activities shall be conducted
in accordance with those conditions. Where no conditions are adequate to protect said resource
area values, the Commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements
of this bylaw. It may also deny a permit: for failure to submit necessary information and plans
requested by the Commission; for failure to comply with the procedures, design specifications,
performance standards, and other requirements in regulations of the Commission; or for failure to
avoid, minimize or mitigate unacceptable significant or cumulative effects upon the resource area
values protected by this bylaw. Due consideration shall be given to any demonstrated hardship on 
the applicant by reason of denial, as presented at the public hearing. The Commission may waive
specifically identified and requested procedures, design specifications, performance standards,
or other requirements set forth in its regulations, provided that: the Commission finds in writing
after said public hearing that there are no reasonable conditions or alternatives that would allow
the proposed activity to proceed in compliance with said regulations; that avoidance, minimization
and mitigation have been employed to the maximum extent feasible; and that the waiver is
necessary to accommodate an overriding public interest or to avoid a decision that so restricts the
use of the property as to constitute an unconstitutional taking without compensation.

In reviewing activities within the buffer zone, the Commission shall presume the buffer zone is
important to the protection of other resource areas because activities undertaken in close
proximity have a high likelihood of adverse impact, either immediately, as a consequence of
construction, or over time, as a consequence of daily operation or existence of the activities.
These adverse impacts from construction and use can include, without limitation, erosion,
siltation, loss of groundwater recharge, poor water quality, and loss of wildlife habitat. The
Commission may establish, in its regulations, design specifications, performance standards, and
other measures and safeguards, including setbacks, no-disturb areas, no-build areas, and other
work limits for protection of such lands, including without limitation strips of continuous,
undisturbed vegetative cover, unless the applicant convinces the Commission that the area or
part of it may be disturbed without harm to the values protected by the bylaw.

In reviewing activities within the riverfront area, the Commission shall presume the riverfront area
is important to all the resource area values unless demonstrated otherwise, and no permit issued
hereunder shall permit any activities unless the applicant, in addition to meeting the otherwise
applicable requirements of this bylaw, has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that (1)
there is no practicable alternative to the proposed project with less adverse effects, and that (2)
such activities, including proposed mitigation measures, will have no significant adverse impact
on the areas or values protected by this bylaw. The Commission shall regard as practicable an
alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration
the proposed property use, overall project purpose (e.g., residential, institutional, commercial, or
industrial), logistics, existing technology, costs of the alternatives, and overall project costs.

To prevent resource area loss, the Commission shall require applicants to avoid alteration
wherever feasible; to minimize alteration; and, where alteration is unavoidable and has been
minimized, to provide full mitigation. The Commission may authorize or require replication of
wetlands as a form of mitigation, but only with specific plans, professional design, proper
safeguards, adequate security, and professional monitoring and reporting to assure success,
because of the high likelihood of failure of replication.

The Commission may require a wildlife habitat study of the project area, to be paid for by the
applicant, whenever it deems appropriate, regardless the type of resource area or the amount or
type of alteration proposed. The decision shall be based upon the Commission’s estimation of the
importance of the habitat area considering (but not limited to) such factors as proximity to other
areas suitable for wildlife, importance of wildlife “corridors” in the area, or actual or possible
presence of rare plant or animal species in the area. The work shall be performed by an individual
who at least meets the qualifications set out in the wildlife habitat Section of the Wetlands
Protection Act regulations (310 CMR 10.60). 

The Commission shall presume that all areas meeting the definition of “vernal pools” under §IX of
this bylaw, including the adjacent area, perform essential habitat functions. This presumption may
be overcome only by the presentation of credible evidence which, in the judgment of the
Commission, demonstrates that the basin or depression does not provide essential habitat
functions. Any formal evaluation should be performed by an individual who at least meets the
qualifications under the wildlife habitat Section of the Wetlands Protection Act regulations.

A permit, Determination of Applicability (DOA), or Order of Resource Area Delineation (ORAD)
shall expire three years from the date of issuance. Notwithstanding the above, the Commission in
its discretion may issue a permit expiring five years from the date of issuance for recurring or
continuous maintenance work, provided that annual notification of time and location of work is
given to the Commission. Any permit may be renewed, except for a DOA, provided that a request
for a renewal is received in writing by the Commission 30 days prior to expiration. Notwithstanding
the above, a permit may identify requirements which shall be enforceable for a stated number of
years, indefinitely, or until permanent protection is in place, and shall apply to all present and
future owners of the land.

For good cause the Commission may revoke any permit, DOA, or ORAD or any other order,
determination or other decision issued under this bylaw after notice to the holder, the public,
abutters, and town boards, pursuant to §V and §VI, and after a public hearing.
Amendments to permits, DOAs, or ORADs shall be handled in the manner set out in the Wetlands
Protection Act regulations and policies there under. The Commission in an appropriate case may
combine the decision issued under this bylaw with the permit, DOA, ORAD, or Certificate of
Compliance (COC) issued under the Wetlands Protection Act and regulations.

No work proposed in any application shall be undertaken until the permit, or ORAD issued by the
Commission with respect to such work has been recorded in the registry of deeds or, if the land
affected is registered land, in the registry Section of the land court for the district wherein the land
lies, and until the holder of the permit certifies in writing to the Commission that the document has
been recorded. If the applicant fails to perform such recording, the Commission may record the
documents itself and require the Applicant to furnish the recording fee therefore, either at the time
of recording or as a condition precedent to the issuance of a COC.

### SECTION 8 REGULATIONS
After public notice and public hearing, the Conservation Commission shall promulgate rules and
regulations to effectuate the purposes of this bylaw, effective when voted and filed with the town
clerk. Failure by the Commission to promulgate such rules and regulations or a legal declaration
of their invalidity by a court of law shall not act to suspend or invalidate the effect of this bylaw. At
a minimum these regulations shall reiterate the terms defined in this bylaw, define additional
terms not inconsistent with the bylaw, and impose consultant fees.

under the Wetlands Protection Act, any confined basin or depression not occurring in existing
lawns, gardens, landscaped areas or driveways which, at least in most years, holds water for a
minimum of two continuous months during the spring and/or summer, contains at least 200 cubic
feet of water at some time during most years, is free of adult predatory fish populations, and
provides essential breeding and rearing habitat functions for amphibian, reptile or other vernal
pool community species, regardless of whether the site has been certified by the Massachusetts
Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. The boundary of the resource area for vernal pools shall be the
mean annual high-water line defining the depression. Except as otherwise provided in this bylaw
or in associated regulations of the Conservation Commission, the definitions of terms and the

and regulations (310 CMR 10.00).

### SECTION 10 SECURITY
As part of a permit issued under this bylaw, in addition to any security required by any other
municipal or state board, agency, or official, the Conservation Commission may require that the
performance and observance of the conditions imposed there under (including conditions
requiring mitigation work) be secured wholly or in part by one or both of the methods described
below:

* (A) By a proper bond, deposit of money or negotiable securities under a written third-party

shall be used only with the consent of the applicant.

### SECTION 11 ENFORCEMENT 
No person shall remove, fill, dredge, build upon, degrade, or otherwise alter resource areas
protected by this bylaw, or cause, suffer, or allow such activity, or leave in place unauthorized fill,
or otherwise fail to restore illegally altered land to its original condition, or fail to comply with a
permit or an enforcement order issued pursuant to this bylaw.

The Conservation Commission, its agents, officers, and employees shall have authority to enter
upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under this bylaw and may
make or cause to be made such examinations, surveys, or sampling as the Commission deems
necessary, subject to the constitutions and laws of the United States and the Commonwealth.

The Commission shall have authority to enforce this bylaw, its regulations, and permits issued
there under by letters, phone calls, electronic communication and other informal methods,
violation notices, non-criminal citations under G.L. Ch. 40 §21D, and civil and criminal court
actions. Any person who violates provisions of this bylaw may be ordered to restore the property
to its original condition and take other action deemed necessary to remedy such violations, or
may be fined, or both.

thereof during which a violation continues, or unauthorized fill or other alteration remains in place,
shall constitute a separate offense, and each provision of the bylaw, regulations, permits, or
administrative orders violated shall constitute a separate offense.

As an alternative to criminal prosecution in a specific case, the Commission may issue citations
with specific penalties pursuant to the non-criminal disposition procedure set forth in G.L. Ch. 40
§21D, which has been adopted within Article 31 of the Town bylaws.

### SECTION 12 BURDEN OF PROOF
The applicant for a permit shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the credible
evidence that the work proposed in the permit application will not have unacceptable significant or
cumulative effect upon the resource area values protected by this bylaw. Failure to provide
adequate evidence to the Conservation Commission supporting this burden shall be sufficient
cause for the Commission to deny a permit or grant a permit with conditions.

### SECTION 13 APPEALS
A decision of the Conservation Commission shall be reviewed in the superior court in accordance
with G.L. Ch. 249 §4.

### SECTION 14 RELATION TO THE WETLANDS PROTECTION ACT
This bylaw is adopted under the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution and
the Home Rule statutes, independent of the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. Ch. 131 §40) and
regulations (310 CMR 10.00) there under. It is the intention of this bylaw that the purposes,
jurisdiction, authority, exemptions, regulations, specifications, standards, and other requirements
shall be interpreted and administered as stricter than those under the Wetlands Protection Act
and regulations.

### SECTION 15 SEVERABILITY

## ARTICLE 33 – PLASTIC BAG REDUCTION
This bylaw shall be known as the Plastic Bag Reduction Bylaw.

### SECTION 1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The production and use of thin-film single-use plastic checkout bags have significant impacts on
the environment, including, but not limited to contributing to the potential death of aquatic and land
animals through ingestion and entanglement; contributing to pollution of the natural environment;
creating a burden to solid waste collection and recycling facilities; clogging storm drainage
systems; and requiring the use of millions of barrels of crude oil nationally for their manufacture.
The purpose of this bylaw is to protect the Town’s unique natural beauty and its water and natural
resources by eliminating single-use plastic checkout bags that are distributed in the Town of
Westborough and to promote the use of reusable bags.

### SECTION 2 DEFINITIONS
“Checkout bag” – means a carryout bag provided by a store to a customer at the point of sale.
Checkout bags shall not include bags, whether plastic or not, in which loose produce or products
are placed by the consumer to deliver such items to the point of sale or checkout area of the store.

floor area is devoted to the sale of food products for home preparation and consumption, which
typically also offers home care and personal care products.

“Retail Store” – means any business facility that sells goods directly to the consumer whether for
or not for profit, including, but not limited to, retail stores, restaurants, pharmacies, convenience
and grocery stores, liquor stores, seasonal and temporary businesses.

“Reusable checkout bag” – means a bag with handles that is specifically designed and
manufactured for multiple reuse and is either polyester, polypropylene, cotton or other durable
material, or durable plastic that is at least 4.0 Mils in thickness.

“Thin-film single -use plastic bags” – are those bags typically with handles, constructed of
high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density
polyethylene (LLDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate ( PET), or
polypropylene (other than woven and non -woven polypropylene fabric), if said film is less than
4.0 mils in thickness.

“Recyclable paper bag” – means a paper bag that is 100 percent recyclable and contains at least
40% post–consumer recycled content, and displays the words “recyclable” and “made from 40%
post-consumer recycled content” in a visible manner on the outside of the bag.

### SECTION 3 USE REGULATIONS
* (A) Thin-film single-use plastic bags shall not be distributed, used, or sold for checkout or
other purposes at any retail store or grocery store within the Town of Westborough.

* (B) If a grocery or retail store provides or sells checkout bags to customers, the bags must be
one of the following (1) recyclable paper bags, or (2) reusable checkout bags. The
grocery or retail store may charge for said bags.

foods, wet items and other similar merchandise, typically without handles, are still
permissible.

### SECTION 4 EFFECTIVE DATE
This bylaw shall take effect six (6) months following Town Meeting approval of the bylaw. Upon
application of the owner or the owner's representative, the Board of Selectmen or their designee
may exempt a grocery retail store from the requirements of this section for a period of up to six (6)
months upon a finding by the Board of Selectmen or their designee that (1) the requirements of
this section would cause undue hardship; or (2) a grocery or retail store requires additional time in
order to draw down an existing inventory of checkout bags.

### SECTION 5 ENFORCEMENT
Enforcement of this bylaw shall be the responsibility of the Board of Selectmen or their designee.
The Board of Selectmen or their designee shall determine the monitoring process to be followed,
which may be limited to responding to citizen reports, incorporating the process into other town
duties as appropriate.

Any grocery or retail store distributing plastic checkout bags in violation of this bylaw shall be
subject to a noncriminal disposition fine as specified in Article 31 of the General Bylaws, 

Noncriminal Disposition of Certain Violations of Bylaws and Rules and Regulations. Any such
fines shall be paid to the Town of Westborough. No licenses shall be renewed for any
establishment with outstanding violations under this section.

### SECTION 6 SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this bylaw is declared invalid or unenforceable the other provisions shall not be
affected thereby.

In lieu of sewer betterment assessments under MGL Ch. 80 & 83, the Town of Westborough shall
hereafter charge a permanent sewer privilege fee as established by this Bylaw. The fees
established herein may be changed from time to time by vote of the Town at any Town Meeting.

### SECTION 3 PAYMENT OF FEE
Upon approval of an application for a sewer permit by the Department of Public Works, the
permanent sewer privilege fee shall be paid. Such fee shall be that which is in effect at the time
the connection is made; or in the case of a change of use of a property previously connected to
the Town sewer system, then the fee in effect at the time an application for a building permit is
filed; or if no such permit is required, then at the time an occupancy permit is issued; or if none,
then at the time the new use begins.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a single family dwelling or dwelling unit in a multiple family
dwelling not in an approved subdivision subject to the provisions of Section 5(a)(1) may elect to
have the permanent sewer privilege fee assessed against the property and such assessment
shall be apportioned in accordance with the provisions of MGL Ch. 80, §13.

year grace period from the effective date in which the sewer becomes available to said property to
connect at the rate of $5,000. At the end of the one year grace period, the rate shall be $10,000
per unit.

* (A) Residential: 
 1. Each single family building connected directly to the Town sewer system shall be
assessed as one unit.

 2. A multiple family dwelling whether connected directly or indirectly and whether in
one or more buildings, shall be assessed as one unit for the first dwelling unit and
one-half unit for each additional dwelling unit.

 3. In the case of an approved subdivision when branch or secondary mains are
installed and paid for by persons other than the Town of Westborough, each single
family dwelling connected to the Town sewer system shall be assessed one-half
unit for a period of five (5) years from the date the Planning Board releases the lot.
Section 5(a)(1) shall apply to all connections made after the original five (5) year
period.

* (B) Commercial, Industrial and Other Uses:
 1. All new uses other than single or multiple family dwellings shall be based on the
Title 5 flow rate (310 CMR 15.203) divided by the estimated flow rate for a
4-bedroom single family residence (440 gallons per day, or one unit) multiplied by
0.5 which will equal the number of units or portion thereof to be charged to the
commercial, industrial or other use. The minimum assessed will be one unit.

 2. Commercial, Industrial and Other Uses may use the Alternative Water
Conservation Unit calculation which will encourage the property owner to install
facilities that will conserve water and reduce the water usage below the calculation
in (4)(b)(1) above. In order to qualify for the Water Conservation Unit calculation,
the property owner must have a professional engineer provide the basis for the
calculation and certify the estimated gallons per day for the facility. This estimate
must be approved by the Town Engineer and the estimated flow will be divided by
the estimated flow for a single family residence (440 gallons per day, or one unit)
which will equal the number of units to be charged to the commercial, industrial or
other use. After two years, the actual usage will be compared with the engineer’s
estimated flow, if the actual usage is higher, the number of units will be
recalculated at the higher usage rate and the property owner will be responsible for
the difference. The initial fee under this Section and any additional fee shall be
collectible as described in Section 6 of this Bylaw.

* (C) Changes in Use:
 1. When a property that exceeds 3,000 square feet (defined as gross square feet
measured on the exterior perimeter of the building multiplied by the number of
floors) has previously been connected to the Town sewer system and the use of
the facility changes then the per unit fee assessed will be the difference between
the fee required under the new use minus the fee required under the original use.
For properties that had paid a fee under the prior Bylaw (prior to March 17, 2012),
the difference shall be the fee required by the new use minus the fee previously 
paid. For properties of less than 3,000 square feet, there will be no additional
sewer connection fee required.

### SECTION 6 SEWER CONNECTION
The owner or occupant of any building upon land abutting on a public or private way, in which
there is a common sewer, shall connect the same therewith by a sufficient drain. A variance from
this requirement may be granted by the Board of Health on the following conditions:

* (A) That said building has a private disposal system in use which meets the requirements of
the Board of Health, said variance to be only for so long as said system continues to meet
those requirements as they may be amended or revised; or

* (B) That said land, by reason of its grade or level or any other cause cannot be drained into
such sewer, until such incapacity is removed and, further, provided that a private septic
system is installed which meets the requirements as they may be amended or revised.

benefited thereby. Such assessment shall be made by filing with the Board of Assessors of the
Town a certificate, designating the way on which the premises connected lies, and giving the
name or names of the owners of the estate for which such connection has been made and the
amount of the assessment to be paid by such owner or owners.

case of registered land, filed in the office of the assistant recorder for the Worcester County
Registry District.

served upon him or on the occupant of such estate, or sent by mail to the last address of the
owner known to the Town Collector pay to the Town Collector the sum of assessed or charged.

### SECTION 8 FEE TO BE LIEN
Except as herein provided, the provisions of the General Laws relative to the assessment,
apportionment, division, re-assessment, abatement, and collection of sewer assessments, to
liens therefore, and to interest thereon shall apply to assessments made under this Bylaw. In
applying said provisions to assessments made under this Bylaw, the notice referred to herein
shall be deemed to be the demand of the Town Collector.

The lien for any assessment made under this act shall attach upon the recording or filing for
registration of the copy or duplicate for the certificate of assessment.

### SECTION 9 SEWER USE FEE

time to time for sewer usage and shall also pay for all service work, materials, and inspection from
the main to the building or buildings serviced.

The following standards shall be applied in planning for stormwater management and erosion
control: 

* (A) All measures in the plan shall meet, at a minimum, the Best Management Practices as set
forth in the Stormwater Management handbook.

* (B) Whenever practical, natural vegetation shall been retained, protected and/or
supplemented. The stripping of vegetation shall be done in a manner that minimizes soil
erosion.

* (C) Temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be installed before any soil
disturbance.

* (D) The area of disturbance shall be kept to a minimum. Disturbed areas remaining idle for
more than 30 days shall be stabilized.

* (E) Measures shall be taken to control erosion within the project area. Sediment in runoff
water shall be trapped and retained within the project area using approved measures.
Wetland areas and surface areas shall be protected from sediment.

* (F) Off-site surface water and runoff from undisturbed areas shall be diverted away from
disturbed areas where feasible or carried through the project area without causing
erosion. Integrity of downstream drainage systems shall be maintained.

* (G) Loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized through the use of infiltration
measures to the maximum extent practicable. The annual recharge from the
post-development site should approximate the annual recharge rate from the
pre-development or existing site conditions, based on soil types.

* (H) Measures shall be taken to control the post-development peak rate of runoff and volume
of runoff so that it does not exceed predevelopment runoff for the two-year, ten-year and
one-hundred-year twenty-four-hour storm event as specified in the design criteria of the
Stormwater Management handbook. The drainage design may, at the discretion of the
enforcing agent, incorporate the use of open space to minimize the change in volume of
runoff in post-development.

* (I) Priority shall be given to preserving natural drainage systems, including perennial and
intermittent streams, wetlands, soils and drainage ditches for conveyance of runoff
entering and leaving the project area.

* (J) When one or more of the Standards cannot be met, an applicant may demonstrate that an
equivalent level of environmental protection will be provided.

* (K) All temporary erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be removed after final
site stabilization. Stabilization measures such as hydro seeding or application of salt
hay/mulch or soil netting shall be applied immediately upon removal of temporary erosion
measures and inspected weekly until stabilization is complete. Trapped sediment and
other disturbed soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall be
permanently stabilized within thirty days unless adverse weather conditions delay
stabilization.
