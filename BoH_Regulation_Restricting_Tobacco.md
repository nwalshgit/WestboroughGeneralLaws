Regulation of the Westborough Board of Health
Restricting the Sale of Tobacco Products

A. __Statement of Purpose__:

Whereas there exists conclusive evidence that tobacco smoking causes cancer, respiratory and cardiac
diseases, negative birth outcomes, irritations to the eyes, nose and throat[^1];

Whereas the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that nicotine is as addictive as
cocaine or heroin[^2] and the Surgeon General found that nicotine exposure during adolescence, a critical
window for brain development, may have lasting adverse consequences for brain development[^3], and that it is
addiction to nicotine that keeps youth smoking past adolescence[^4].

Whereas a Federal District Court found that Phillip Morris, RJ Reynolds and other leading cigarette
manufacturers “spent billions of dollars every year on their marketing activities in order to encourage young
people to try and then continue purchasing their cigarette products in order to provide the replacement
smokers they need to survive” and that these companies were likely to continue targeting underage smokers[^5];

Whereas more than 80 percent of all adult smokers begin smoking before the age of 18, more than 90 percent
do so before leaving their teens, and more than 3.5 million middle and high school students smoke[^6];

Whereas 18.1 percent of current smokers aged <18 years reported that they _usually_ directly purchased their
cigarettes from stores (i.e. convenience store, supermarket, or discount store) or gas stations, and among 11<sup>th</sup>
grade males this rate was nearly 30 percent[^7];

Whereas cigars and cigarillos, can be sold in a single “dose”; enjoy a relatively low tax as compared to
cigarettes; are available in fruit, candy and alcohol flavors; and are popular among youth[^8];

Whereas 59% of high school smokers in Massachusetts have tried flavored cigarettes or flavored cigars and
25.6% of them are current flavored tobacco product users; 95.1 % of 12-17 year olds who smoked cigars
reported smoking cigar brands that were flavored[^9]:

Whereas the federal Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA), enacted in 2009,
prohibited candy- and fruit-flavored cigarettes,[^10] largely because these flavored products were marketed to
youth and young aduits,[^11] and younger smokers were more likely to have tried these products than older
smokers[^12], neither federal nor Massachusetts laws restrict sales of flavored non-cigarette tobacco products,
such as cigars, cigarillos, smokeless tobacco, hookah tobacco, and electronic devices and the nicotine
solutions used in these devices;

Whereas the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Surgeon General have stated that flavored
tobacco products are considered to be “starter” products that help establish smoking habits that can lead to
long-term addiction[^13];

Whereas the U.S. Surgeon General recognized in his 2014 report that a complementary strategy to assist in
eradicating tobacco related death and disease is for local governments to ban categories of products from
retail sale[^14];

Whereas the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that the current use of electronic
cigarettes, a product sold in dozens of flavors that appeal to youth, among middle and high school students
tripled from 2013 to 2014;[^15]

Whereas 5.8% of Massachusetts youth currently use e-cigarettes and 15.9% have tried them;[^16]

Whereas the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection has classified liquid nicotine in any
amount as an “acutely hazardous waste”:[^17]

Whereas in a lab analysis conducted by the FDA, electronic cigarette cartridges that were labeled as
containing no nicotine actually had low levels of nicotine present in all cartridges tested, except for one[^18];

Whereas data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey indicate that more than two-fifths of U.S. middle and
high school smokers report using flavored little cigars or flavored cigarettes[^19];

Whereas the sale of tobacco products is incompatible with the mission of health care institutions because
these products are detrimental to the public health and their presence in health care institutions undermine
efforts to educate patients on the safe and effective use of medication, including cessation medication;

Whereas educational institutions sell tobacco products to a younger population, who is particularly at risk for
becoming smokers and such sale of tobacco products is incompatible with the mission of educational
institutions that educate a younger population about social, environmental and health risks and harms;

Whereas the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that “. . . [t]he right to engage in business must
yield to the paramount right of government to protect the public health by any rational means”[^20],

Now, therefore it is the intention of the Westborough Board of Health to regulate the sale of tobacco
products.
